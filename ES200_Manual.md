2. **The ES200 Unit**

ES200 is a control, monitoring and data acquisition. It is the ideal solution both for automation and control of transformation, power or connection points and for local SCADA systems.

Our solution works in a distributed architecture, along with the software and devices commonly used today. However, ES200 also allows backward compatibility with legacy equipment. Therefore, it can communicate with standard, legacy and modern devices, thus being a versatile solution that greatly improves security and automation functions.

ES200 is able to run, deploy and operate at the Network Edge, while securely isolating SCADA microservices from any other process. It enables data extraction, concentration, processing and storage by acting as a SCADA gateway.



    5. **_ Use cases_**

ES200 features monitoring, control and communication gateway functions. The system allows the capture of intelligent protection (IED signals), as well as the direct acquisition of digital signals. The ES200 has a wide range of standard protocols (detailed in section 2.4) for monitoring and transmitting information to the higher level. Also, ES200 can store a history of up to 500,000 events stored in non-volatile memory that are described by:



* The time tag identifying the time at which the event occurred (accuracy of 1ms);
* Source of the event;
* Condition before the event;
* Condition after event;
    6. **_ System architecture_**

The next figures show a general application architecture and an example of a deployment architecture.

**Figure 3: Example of ES200 deployment architecture**



    7. **_Supported comunication protocols_**

Communications protocols supported by the ES200 include Modbus, DNP3, IEC 60870-5-104 and IEC 61850. These protocols are currently being used by a wide range of modern protection equipment and IEDs, therefore our solution can be easily deployed with existing equipment. Also, the list of available communication protocols is expanding, other protocols being developed on demand.

Depending on the hardware platform that supports it, the ES200 can directly control and transmit information via its own I/O modules. Below you can find a list of the currently supported communication protocols.

* Unit info - information about the selected equipment ( name, channel etc.). The editable fields can be changed according to new requirements.
* Equipment Properties - additional information about the selected equipment and the communication protocol it uses. Each field has a help text that will show when you hover over the field name.
* Channel Settings – information regarding the channel (Serial/TCP) used by the equipment for communication purposes. 
        5. **_Database table (5)_**

A table-like interface that offers information about the points of the selected equipment. By double clicking a field, you can change its content either by selecting one of the given options (when the field has certain content restrictions) or by manually inputting the new content.



        6. **_Errors table (6)_**

In this table you can see the configuration errors of a database. For example: equipment with the same name, duplicate points etc.



    9. **_Adding and editing entities in the database_**
        7. **_Command centers: _**

You can add a new CC device by using the Add slave device option from the Edit button in the Main Toolbar, and selecting the protocol you want the new Command Center to use. Afterwards, you will be able to add additional creation information in the designated area (Figure 10).

An alternative method is to right-click Command Centers and click the Add Device button, selecting the protocol in the EquipmentProcess drop down menu.

**Figure 10**: ES200 database configuration interface – adding a new Command Center

The editable fields are:



* Equipment Name - the name you want the equipment to have so it is easy to identify;
* Equipment Process – from a drop-down menu, you can select which protocol you want this Command Center to use;
* Equipment Description – a short sentence that can help identify the equipment’s purpose;
* Equipment Active – activating this field means the equipment is active, unticking it means the equipment will be inactive;
* Use Existing Channel – activating this option will allow you to select an already configured communication channel from a drop down list. Unticking it means you have to configure a new channel.
* If you are configuring a new channel:
    * Channel Type – from the drop-down menu, you can select if you want the Command Center to communicate using a Serial or a TCP connection. Depending on your selection, you will have specific connection properties to edit. (Figure 11);
    * Channel Description – a short sentence that can help you identify the channel and its settings.

**Figure 11: Serial and TCP connection options**



1. The Serial Channel has the following editable parameters:
    * BAUDRATE – the speed of the connection (bits/second);
    * DATABITS – the number of bits in each character;
    * STOPBITS – the number of bits used to detect the end of a character;
    * PARITY – a method used for detecting errors in communication;
    * RTSCONTROL – a method used to ensure the sender speed is not higher than the rate at which the receiver can process the data;
    * PORT - the port which the equipment will use to communicate

    These parameters must have the same value at both ends of the connection, therefore you must select the values from the drop-down menus based on the equipment you are connecting to the ES200.

2. The TCP Channel has the following parameters:
    * IP – the IP address of the equipment
    * PORT – the port which the equipment will use to communicate through TCP

All these settings can be edited after the creation of the Command Center. You can do so by clicking on the specific slave you want to modify and then change the settings in the tabs from the Equipment Settings section (as shown in Figure 12)

**Figure 12**: ES200 database configuration interface – editing a Command Center

A Command Center can be deleted by clicking on it, then right-clicking it and selecting Delete equipment. Alternatively, you can select am equipment and use the Delete key.



        8. **_Intelligent Electronic Devices_**

Adding an IED is similar to adding a Command Center. By clicking the Edit button and selecting Add master device, you will be asked to select the protocol you want the new device to use. Then, the process is identical to the previous chapter, as shown in Figure 13.

An alternative method is selecting and right-clicking Intelligent Electronic Device and selecting Add Device. The protocol can later be selected from the Equipment Process drop down menu.

![alt_text](images/image14.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 13**: ES200 database configuration interface – adding a Remote Terminal Unit

The editable fields are:



* Equipment Name - the name you want the equipment to have so it is easy to identify;
* Equipment Process – from a drop-down menu, you can select which protocol you want this IED to use;
* Equipment Description – a short sentence that can help identify the equipment’s purpose;
* Equipment Active – activating this field means the equipment is active, unticking it means the equipment will be inactive;
* Use Existing Channel – activating this option will allow you to select an already configured communication channel from a drop down list. Unticking it means you have to configure a new channel.
* If you are configuring a new channel:
    * Channel Type – from the drop-down menu, you can select if you want the Command Center to communicate using a Serial or a TCP connection. Depending on your selection, you will have specific connection properties to edit, as explained bellow
    * Channel Description – a short sentence that can help you identify the channel and its settings.

Depending on which channel you selected, the parameters that you have to fill in are different and are explaind in the following lists:



1. The Serial Channel has the following editable parameters:
    * BAUDRATE – the speed of the connection (bits/second);
    * DATABITS – the number of bits in each character;
    * STOPBITS – the number of bits used to detect the end of a character;
    * PARITY – a method used for detecting errors in communication;
    * RTSCONTROL – a method used to ensure the sender speed is not higher than the rate at which the receiver can process the data;
    * PORT - the port which the equipment will use to communicate

    These parameters must have the same value at both ends of the connection, therefore you must select the values from the drop-down menus based on the equipment you are connecting to the ES200.

2. The TCP Channel has the following parameters:
    * IP – the IP address of the equipment
    * PORT – the port which the equipment will use to communicate through TCP

All these settings can be edited after the creation of the IED. You can do so by clicking on the specific master you want to modify and then change the settings in the settings submenus from the lower left part of the window, just like you would do if you wanted to modify the properties of a Command Center.



        9. **_Points_**

The procedure for adding a new point to either a Command Center or a Intelligent Electronic Device is extremely similar. 

The first step is to expand the equipment’s point options by clicking on the arrow to its left. Afterwards, by selecting and then right-clicking the desired point type, you can select the Add point(s) option, that will open a dialogue box (Figure 14) where you can input:



* Starting Address – the address of the first point you wish to add;
* Number of Points – the number of points you wish to add.

![alt_text](images/image15.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 14**: ES200 database configuration interface – adding a point

After the addition, the new points will appear in the table belonging to the equipment where they were added. The editing process will be covered in the next chapter. In order to delete a point, you can select the row in the table by clicking on it and then right-clicking it and selecting the Delete item option.



        10. **_ Editing the table entries for a Command Center_**

In the table in the right of the selected Command Center, you can view or edit the points that the Command Center will receive. Every editable value can be modified by double-clicking the cell you wish to edit. The editable columns of the table are:



* ADDRESS – The address of the point
* Master Variable Name – The name of the correspondent of the point in the Master’s point list. The new value can be selected from a drop-down menu. Selecting a master point will make the row become white.
        11. **_Editing the table entries for an IED_**

The table in the right of the selected IED can be used to edit the points that the IED will send. Every editable value can be modified by double-clicking the cell you wish to edit.

The editable columns of the table are:



* ADDRESS – The address of the point. 
* Description – a short phrase that can help the identify and understand the purpose of the points. 
* Variable Name – the name of the variable stored in the point
    10. _ Downloading and uploading the database to ES200_
        12. **_Downloading the database_**

In some use cases, the database that is currently in use on the ES200 will need to be modified. In order to do that, you must import it locally and edit it with the Dashboard application. For this, use the File -> Download Project menu. This will open a window in which you can enter the required connection information.



<p id="gdcalert17" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image17.png).

![alt_text](images/image17.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 16: ES200 database configuration interface – connecting to ES Remote**

After entering your credentials, you will be asked to navigate through your own computer and select where you want the remote database to be saved and what name you want it to have. 



        13. **_Uploading the database_**

After editing a database, in order to use it with the ES200 application, you must upload it to the system running ES200. You can do this from the Dashboard application by using the File -> Upload Project menu. Just like when importing a database, you will be asked for the information necessary to establish a connection. 

After entering the required information, you will be asked to select which local file you want to upload to the system. The location in which it is updated is standard, therefore its unnecessary for you to select it.



    11. **_ Viewing the points_**

The Dashboard offers you an interface where you can see the points’ status. This interface – called Entity Viewer – also allows you to send commands to the points. To access this interface, use the File -> New EntityViewer and connect to an equipment running the ES200.



<p id="gdcalert18" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image18.png).

![alt_text](images/image19.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 18: ES200 EntityViewer – The EntitifyViewer interface**

Here, you can set the refresh rate (in the example window above, it is set at 2 seconds) and you can view the time of the last refresh and the status of the connection. If the connection is paused (as you can see above), you can reconnect to the equipment by clicking the Play button. If the connection has been lost, you can reattempt a connection by clicking Stop and then Play.

The points are grouped by protocol. Next to each protocol name, you can see how many points of that type are in the database. By using the arrow next to each protocol name, you can expand (or contract) the points. 

After expanding the points, you can see the description of each point, its type, address and value. You can also filter the results by type and address in the header row of the table. For filtering by type, use the dropdown menu. If you want to filter by address, write the starting and ending address in the fields in the header row. If you only want one address, write the same value in both fields.

For each and every point, there are timestamps corresponding to different events:



* Protocol timestamp
* Internal timestamp - the timestamp recorded by the device hosting ES200 - it corresponds with the last event occurred on that point

There is a button in the top right corner of the window labeled “Open Console” - once you press it, a terminal of the ES200 hosting device will be opened.

On the right side, there is a timer labeled “ES200 Time”. It indicates the actual timestamp of the ES200 hosting device. This will update along the refresh interval configured earlier.

There is an indicator on the left side of the status bar which shows the connection status. It glows green if there is connection between the ES200 hosting device and the Dashboard and red otherwise.

![alt_text](images/image20.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 19: Entity Viewer - Starting button**

When a new project is uploaded, the processes are restarted, therefore, it is necessary for the Entity Viewer to be manually started to start the connection with the ES200.



    12. **_ Sending commands_**

In order to send command to any of the points, you can use the EntityViewer interface. Next to each output point value, there is a textbox cell where you can write the command you want to send. These cells are on the Command column. Only the cells corresponding to points that can receive commands are active textbox cells that can be edited. 

After writing the desired command and clicking the Enter key on your keyboard, the command will be sent, and the result will be shown into the Status column. This behaviour is available only for “Output” points. You can see an example of a written command in the figure below:



<p id="gdcalert21" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image21.png).

![alt_text](images/image21.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 20: ES200 EntityViewer – Sent command shown in the Status column**

If there are multiple commands sent on  the same point, the actual label will be replaced with the most recent one, and on the right side of the label, the number of commands that have been sent will be displayed.

    13. Force points value

Point value forcing is a feature usually used for testing. In order to do it, you have to fill the field under the “Value” of the “Input” points and then press Enter. Once forced, a point will be labeled accordingly in the status column.



<p id="gdcalert23" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image23.png).

![alt_text](images/image23.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 22: ES200 EntityViewer – force point value**

To stop a point value from being forced, press the “x” icon inside the “Forced Value” label. This way, the point value will come back to its initial value after about 10 seconds, if the points are valid.



5. Configuration example
    14. **_ Hypothetic use case_**

Let’s assume you want to gather data from a Modbus equipment and you want to send that data to a Command Center using the IEC 104 protocol. To do this, we will need to create the two pieces of equipment in the Dashboard, add the points to each of them and connect the points. This chapter will show you how to do that. 

First, you need to start a new project. To do that, click File -> New Project and select the latest version (1.4)



<p id="gdcalert24" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image24.png).

**Figure 24: ES200 configuration example – Adding a new IED**

In the Equipment Name field, write the name you want to give to the device. Use a sugestive name. Then, use the Equipment Process drop down menu to select the communication protocol you want to use. In our case, I chose Modbus Master. You can also select the channel type. In our case, I chose the SERIAL channel and I left all the default for the connection at their default values. After finishing the configuration, click Insert.

Then, we must configure the points for the new IED. To do that, click the arrow next to the equipment name to view the point options. For this use case I will create 10 Discrete Input Register points. To do that, right click the Discrete Input Register option and select Add Points. Then write the first address and the number of points you want.

The dialogue box for adding the 10 points is shown in the next figure. This is the setup for the IEDs for this example.

    16. **_ Command Center Configuration_**

In order to onfigure the Command Center, we must first create it. To do this, right click the Command Center button and select Add item. 

The next figure shows the interface where you can customize the Command Center. There, you can give a suggestive name for your equipment using the Equipment Name field. You can also select the communication protocol for the new equipment using the Equipment Process drop-down menu.

You can also select the type of connection to the Command Center using the Channel Type drop down menu. In our example, I used the TCP connection and I added the IP & Port of the Command Center.

![alt_text](images/image27.png "image_tooltip")


**Figure 26: ES200 configuration example – Adding a new Command Center**

After you click Insert, the new Command Center will be created. Now we need to add the corresponding 10 points. Because the IED has 10 Discrete Input Register points, the correspondent for that type of data in the IEC 104 protocol is the Single Point Information type.

Therefore, you must click the arrow next to the new Command Center to expand the point types. Then, right click the Single Point Information and select Add point(s). In the pop-up window, write the starting address and the number of points you want. Then click ok. The end result should look like the next figure. 

Now that we have created the points, we need to connect them to the points from the IED. To do this, click the Master Variable Name column and select the corresponding point from the drop-down menu, as shown in the next figure.

_6.4. Logic block editor_


* 
MultiDataMaster is a module that can be used to implement specific automation logic, similar to those implemented in a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller). AAR (Automatic Reserve Arrangement) type automation can be implemented, double variables can be created for switchgear positions by adding simple (Boolean) variables, summations of analog values, and various conditionings.

* 
The module provides predefined blocks specific to the standard programming languages (LD, FBD, SFC) used for PLC configuration. Blocks can be grouped into several distinct categories:


* 
blocks for logic operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR;


* 
blocks for bit operations: left/right shift with a predefined number of positions

**ModbusType - Modbus RTU, ASCII or TCP communication type is selected. The Modbus type (RTU, ASCII or TCP) is described in the relay or PLC documentation. Modbus RTU or ASCII is used in situations where a serial link (RS232 or RS485) is used between the HW ES200 and the PLC or relay.**

**HoldingReglnterval - The time interval at which the Modbus master in the ES200 sends a polling (polling) message to the holding-register addresses.**

**InputRegInterval - The time interval at which the Modbus master in the ES200 sends a polling message on Input-register addresses.**

**CoilInterval - The time interval at which the Modbus master in the ES200 sends a message to Coil addresses**

**DiscreteInputsInterval - The time interval at which the Modbus master in the ES200 sends a polling message on DiscreteInput addresses.**

**UseGroups - parameter that enables/disables the use of address groups in response to a polling message sent to the slave**

**CommandTimeout - the time interval after which if the command is not executed and no response is received from the slave it is considered to have failed.**

**Invalidate TimeOut - the time interval after which the read margins become invalid if the slave does not respond to the polling for a certain time interval.**

**ValidateCommands - parameter whose activation activates the mechanism to send a general query to the address to which the command was sent.**

**CommandValidationInterval - the time after issuing a command on an address, after which the ES200 considers that entity invalid if it has not received a response to the query sent to the slave.**

**CriticalInterval - Certain addresses may be set to be read at a time interval other than that intended for general Modbus-specific entity types. **

**MaxGroupLength - the maximum number of addresses that form an address group that will be polled with a single polling message (can be any value 0-120).**

**Adding Discrete Input Register digital inputs **

**Discrete Input Register margins are commonly used for binary margins on Modbus communication.**

**Address - The address of the Discrete Input Register binary information read from the slave equipment. If the information is read from a Discrete Input Register word this column is filled with -1. **

**Description - Detailed description of the entity being retrieved - for internal use (e.g.: Maximum protection operation step 1).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for that signal and will be used in saved processes and for automation logic.**

**SOURCEDATA - allows to retrieve a specific bit from a Word with a predefined address from the integrated slave hardware. The format of this field is as follows:**

**- AIxx|y - to retrieve a bit from a word of type Discrete Input Register or Input register**

**- AOxx|y - to retrieve a bit from a word of type Holding Register or Coil.**

**AOxx|y - to retrieve a bit from a Holding Register or Coil word.**

**In the format defined above "xx" is the numeric address of the word to be read from and "y" is the number of the bit to be read (0 is the least significant bit and 7 is the most significant bit).**

**IsCritical - allows the entity to be placed in a special group of addresses to be read periodically at the CriticalInterval set in the general settings area.**



* 7.1.4. Adding Coil digital controls

**Coil sizes are commonly used to perform commands on Modbus communication**

**Address - The address of the Coil binary information read from the slave equipment. If the information is read from a Discrete Input Register word this column is filled with -1. **

**Description - Detailed description of the entity being retrieved - for internal use (e.g.: Maximum protection operation step 1).**

**CmdType - Pulse/ Latch. Pulse, transient command. Will keep the command active for the duration set to "Pulse duration". Latch, the command is automatically maintained until a new cancel command is given (operation is influenced by the type of equipment or the type of installation to be controlled).**

**Pulse Duration - Pulse command duration (ms).**

**Source - allows control in ES of one bit of a HoldingRegisters size. The format of this field is as follows: **

**- AOxx|y - to control one bit of a Holding Register.**

**In the format defined above "xx" is the numeric address of the word from which the command is to be made, and "y" is the number of the bit to be controlled (0 is the least significant bit and 7 is the most significant bit).**

**If this field is filled, the Address field should be filled with the value "-1".**

**CommandValidationPoint - List of the TAGs of entities (binary or analogue inputs) separated by a comma, which are to be affected by the performance of the command in question.**

**IsCritical - allows the entity to be placed in a special group of Coil addresses that will be read periodically at the CriticalInterval set in the general configuration area.**



* 7.1.5. Adding analog input sizes - Input Register

** Address - Address of the Discrete Input Register binary information read from the slave equipment. If the information is read from a Discret Input Register word this column is filled with -1. **

**Description - Detailed description of the entity being retrieved - for internal use (e.g.: Maximum protection operation step 1).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for that signal and will be used in saved processes and for automation logic.**

**WordCount - Specifies the number of registers used to read a magnitude. By default this column has a value of 1 because most magnitudes are stored in a single register. Other possible values are 2 and 4. These are used for float sizes (which are stored in 2 registers) or large integer sizes (which are stored in 4 registers). The details depend on each device and are given in its documentation.**

**LittleEndian - The direction (left to right or right to left) in which bits are read from the word(s) represented by the address analogue sizes - LittleEndian - left to right (when the option is selected) or BigEndian (when the option is not activated - right to left).**

**ValueType - data type associated with analogue quantities (signed, unsigned, floating point) - the description of the data type should be found in the relay documentation.**

**Holding Register margins are commonly used for analogue command margins on Modbus communication.**

**Address - The address of the Holding Register binary information read from the slave equipment. Description - Detailed description of the entity being retrieved - for internal use (e.g. power limit setting).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for the respective command and will be used within the saved processes and for the realization of automation logic.**

**WordCount - Specifies the register number used to set a magnitude. By default this column has a value of 1 because most magnitudes are stored in a single register. Other possible values are 2 and 4. These are used for float sizes (which are stored in 2 registers) or large integer sizes (which are stored in 4 registers). The details depend on each device and are given in its documentation.**

![alt_text](images/image52.png "image_tooltip")


**  Source - represents the numeric ID of the communication master in a DNP3.0 session, internal to the DNP3.0 protocol. In equipment communicating over DNP3.0 it is necessary to set the source address (master) and the destination address (oustation or slave);**

**Destination - represents the slave address (outstation) of the IED with which the DNP3.0 master of the ES200 is going to establish a communication link.In case we have several devices on serial communication connected on the same serial port (RS485 loop), each device must have a different slave address;**

**AppConf - parameter to enable/disable the generation of DNP3.0 frame receipt confirmation messages at Application level;**

**AutoDelayMeas - enables/disables the delay measurements mechanism within the time synchronization procedure especially when using the SERIAL (Object 50 variation 1) time synchronization model;**

**AutoTimeSync - allows the choice of the time synchronization pattern for the IED communicating with the ES200. The ES200 sends upon IED request, telegrams specific to the internal type synchronization of the requesting IED. Two time synchronization models can be used - SERIAL (Object 50 variation 1) and LAN (Object 50 variation 3), the supported model is described in the IED documentation;**

**AutoClearRestart - allows the setting of IIN status bits to be enabled when initializing communication or restarting an IED;**

**AutoIntegRestart - enables the ES200 DNP3.0 master to send an Interity Poll message to an IED after resetting the IED or reinitialising the link to the IED;**

**AutoIntegOverflow - enables the ES200 DNP3.0 master to send an Interity Poll message to an IED after receiving its event buffer fill message;**

**AutoIntegTimeout - enables the ES200 DNP3.0 master to send an Interity Poll message to an IED after a timeout set for the communication channel with the IED;**

**EnableUnsol - allows an unsolicited responses message to be sent to an IED. Unsolicited responses is the mechanism for sending events from a DNP3.0 slave to the master without the need for periodic interrogation of the slave (event driven mechanism in DNP3). If the IED does not have the possibility to send unsolicited messages, it will report the events via the RBE (report by exception) mechanism at each general query it receives from the master in the ES200;**

**IntegrityPoolInterval - The time interval (seconds) at which the Master sends an interity poll message to the IED it is communicating with;**

**LinkStatusInterval - the parameter that sets the periodicity of sending link level status check messages between the master and the IED;**

**ChannelResponseTimeout - represents the time the DNP3Master waits for a response to a request that has been sent at the application level;**

**LinkConfirmTimeout - the maximum time for DNP3Master to wait for link level status confirmation messages after DNP3Master has issued a request for link level status verification;**

**LinkConfirmMode - allows setting the mode of waiting for application level confirmation messages. Possible values are NEVER (only confirmation of unsolicited messages transmitted by slaves), SOMETIMES, ALWAYS (requires confirmation for all messages transmitted between master and slaves). If NEVER is set the link level verification mechanism (LINK) configured by the LinkStatusInterval and LinkConfirmTimeout parameters remains in place. It is important that the equivalent parameter in the IED is set to the same value (NEVER, SOMETIMES or ALWAYS) as in the ES200.**

**MaxRequestRetries - The maximum number of requests sent to the IED that have not been answered after the timeout intervals set above have expired before the connection is terminated by DNP3Master.**



* 7.2.3. Adding digital sizes

**Address - Address of the Binary input information taken from the FDI. The address map can be created by configuring the IED using the specific configuration sw or in the IED technical documentation.**

**Description - Detailed description of the retrieved entity - for internal use (e.g.: Maximum protection operation step 1).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for that signal and will be used within the saved processes and for the realization of automation logic.**



* 7.2.4. Adding analogue sizes

**Address - The address of the analogue input information taken from the IED. The address map can be created by configuring the IED using the specific configuration sw or in the IED technical documentation.**

**Description - Detailed description of the retrieved entity - for internal use (e.g. Current value phase A).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for that signal and will be used within the saved processes and for the realization of automation logic.**



* 7.2.5. Adding commands

**Address - Address of the binary output information read from the slave equipment. Description - Detailed description of the retrieved entity - for internal use (e.g. Separator command).**

**Variable Name - Fill in a unique TAG for each signal. This TAG will be the internal identifier for the respective command and will be used in the save processes and for the realization of automation logic.**

**CmdType - Pulse/ Latch/ Open_Close. Pulse, transient command. Will keep the command active for the duration set by the parameter "Pulse duration". Latch, the command is automatically maintained until a new cancel command is given. Open/Close - simple command especially on switching equipment. The type of command used depends on the IED configuration (made with specific configuration sw or documented in the IED technical specification).**

**Pulse Duration - Pulse command duration (ms).**

**Mode - Control pattern for the commands. There are 3 possible values Direct operate, Direct operate no ack, Select before Execute.The type of command model used depends on the IED configuration (made with specific configuration sw or documented in the IED technical specification).**

**HasTimeTag - setting this parameter causes binary and double status flags sent to the master to be accompanied by the time tag;**

**InvalidClockSync [ms] - After expiry of this time interval, the time tag associated with the IEC-104 salvo becomes invalid and a new time synchronization request (ASDU type 103) must be issued by the master. If time synchronization is done periodically by the master card, the master synchronization time interval must be less than this parameter.**

**CyclicPeriod [ms] - General interval representing the period used to send quantities with cyclic set as transmission mode. The other modes for sending magnitudes as an event are a change in jitter or validity;**

**CyclicAfterGi - if this parameter is set, the es200 will no longer send to the master sizes with cyclic transmission mode set (in the table corresponding to the size type) cyclic requests before the first general query request issued by the master.**



* 8.1.3. Adding digital sizes

**Single-Point Information and Double-Point Information sections are used, depending on the type of information to be transmitted to the command center.**

**The IEC-60870-5-104 protocol allows the use of 2 types of status sizes - binary and double. Double type sizes are used for transmission and monitoring of switchgear status. Switching equipment (splitters, circuit breakers) have 4 states required to be monitored - intermediate (value 0), open/disconnected (value 1), closed/connected (value 2), fault ( value 3).**

**The entities whose state is to be sent to the command center are those taken from the IEDs and will be chosen from the list available in the Master Variable Name section. The name of the IED from which the information is retrieved is automatically filled in after the choice of the entity.**

**Address - Address of the Binary input information to be sent to the command center. In the command center it is necessary to add an identical address for receiving the entity state.**

**Validity - Enabling this option allows the IEC-104 slave process in the ES200 to initiate the sending of an event to the command centre when the quality of the monitored entity information changes;**

**Cyclic - Enabling this option allows the IEC-104 slave process in the ES200 to initiate the cyclic sending, with the periodicity set by the CyclicPeriod parameter (paragraph 6.1.2), of the status and quality information related to the entity in question. We do not recommend using this option, as IEC-104 is a protocol based on spontaneous transmission of status changes in the form of events.**



* 8.1.4. Adding analogue sizes

**Normalized, Scaled, Short Floating sections are used depending on the type of analogue size information to be transmitted to the control center.**

**The IEC-60870-5-104 protocol allows the use of 3 types of analogue quantities - Normalized, Scaled, Short Floating. For the ES200 we currently use the Short Floating data type.**

**The analog quantities whose status is to be sent to the control center are those taken from the IEDs and will be chosen from the list available in the Master Variable Name section. The name of the IED from which the information is retrieved is automatically filled in after the choice of the entity.**

**Address - The address of the analogue size information to be transmitted to the command center. In the command center it is necessary to add an identical address for receiving the entity state.**

**Validity - Enabling this option allows the IEC-104 slave process in the ES200 to initiate the sending of an event to the command centre when the quality of the monitored entity information changes;**

**Jitter - Enabling this option allows the IEC-104 slave process in the ES200 to initiate the sending of the analog magnitude value to the command center when a certain settable threshold is exceeded. The mechanism allows that following a variation (+ or -) greater than a set value (Variation field) of the instantaneous value of the magnitude transmitted by the IED relative to the last value recorded by the ES200, an event containing the instantaneous value of the magnitude will be generated by the IEC-104 slave and sent to the command centre;**

**Variation - the value of the minimum threshold required to initiate the procedure for the transmission of the value of the analogue quantity in question by the ES200 to the command center. A variation greater than the value set in this field of the instantaneous value of the measurement transmitted by the IED relative to its last reading generates an event and will be sent to the command center.**

**Cyclic - Enabling this option allows the IEC-104 slave process in the ES200 to initiate the cyclic sending, with the periodicity set by the CyclicPeriod parameter (paragraph 6.1.2 ), of status and quality information related to the entity in question. We do not recommend using this option, as IEC-104 is a protocol based on spontaneous transmission of status changes in the form of events.**



* 8.1.5. Adding commands

**Single-Point Command and Double-Point Command sections are used, depending on the type of commands to be received from the command center and subsequently transmitted to the IEDs.The IEC-60870-5-104 protocol implemented by the ES200 allows the use of 2 types of commands - binary and double. Dual type commands can be used to control switching equipment if the dispatching platforms force the use of these commands. The types of commands configured in the command center must be identical to those configured in the ES200 for them to work.**

**The commands to be received from the command center are what will be sent to the IEDs and will be chosen from the list available in the Master Variable Name section. The IED name from which the information is retrieved is automatically filled in after the choice of entities (Master Equipment).**

**Address - The address of the command type information to be transmitted by the command center. In the command center it is necessary to add an identical address for the reception of the command by the ES200;**

**Conversion - The value received from the command center on the IEC-104 address of the entity can be converted into another value to be sent on protocol down to the protection relays or PLCs in the PT. (e.g.: the value 1 is received on IEC-104, but the value 0 must be sent to the relay: 1>0 must be entered in the database);**

**CmdMode - represents the control model - With Select (Select Before Operate), Without Select (Direct Operate). If the control model set in the dispatcher is not known, the Any option is used;**

**CmdQualifier - represents the qualifier property of the control. Possible values for this field - Default, Short pulse, Long pulse, Persistent. The command qualifier type must be identical to the equivalent command in the command center. If the control model set in the dispatcher is not known the Any option is used;**

**The window above configures the main properties of the TCP communication channel between the ES200 and the command center. The control center name (Equipment name) and the general description of the control center (Equipment Description) do not influence the specific communication characteristics of the Modbus TCP protocol. It is necessary to fill in the TCP port to be used. The IP address is not required to connect to the control center. The IP address of the control center can be filled in this field if it is desired to ensure the exclusivity of the Modbus TCP connection between the ES200 and the control center having the IP address in question.**

**After adding a new command center and configuring as described in section 4.2.1, we will have the information below available for editing where:**

**Channel Description - the name of the communication channel. Does not affect communication with devices helping to organize information.**

**IP : IP address of the command center - we recommend that this field remains blank. The IP address of the control center can be filled in this field if it is desired to ensure the exclusivity of the Modbus connection between the ES200 and the control center having the IP address in question.**

**Port : TCP port through which the TCP/IP communication with the equipment is made (for Modbus TCP the most used port is 10502).**

**SLAVEID - protocol address of the ES200 acting as a slave link to the master. This address must be identical to the address set in the command center (Modbus communication master) for initiating application level communication on this protocol.**

**ModbusType - The only accepted setting is TCP.**



* 8.2.3. Adding digital, analogue and command sizes

**The entities whose status is to be sent to the command center are those taken from the IEDs and will be chosen from the list available in the Master Variable Name section. The IED name from which the information is retrieved is automatically filled in after the entity is chosen.**

**The commands to be received from the command center are those to be passed to the IEDs and will be chosen from the list available in the Master Variable Name section. The IED name from which the information is retrieved is automatically filled in after the choice of the entity (Master Equipment).**

**Address - Address of the entity to be transmitted to the command center. In the command center it is necessary to add an identical address for receiving the entity status. The same principle applies for commands.**
